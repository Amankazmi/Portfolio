            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Aman Kazmi, and I'm passionate about all things technology! Currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology at L.D College of Engineering, I'm on a mission to leverage cutting-edge solutions to solve real-world problems. My academic journey has exposed me to a diverse range of IT disciplines, from programming and web development to cybersecurity, data analysis, and Android development. I thrive in the world of coding and problem-solving, constantly seeking new challenges to expand my skills. Beyond the classroom, I'm a national player of hockey and I'm an advocate for continuous learning and enjoy staying updated on emerging tech trends. I'm particularly intrigued by the potential of artificial intelligence and its impact on various industries. I'm excited to connect with fellow IT enthusiasts, professionals, and mentors who share my passion for technology. Let's network, share insights, and explore opportunities to make a meaningful impact in the world of IT together.</p>
            <p>Feel free to explore my portfolio and get in touch with me for any collaboration or project opportunities.</p>
